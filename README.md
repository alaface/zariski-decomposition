# Zariski Decomposition in Magma

This repository collects implementations of **Zariski decomposition** algorithms in Magma.

## Contents

- [`/surfaces/`](./surfaces/) — Zariski decomposition for divisors on algebraic surfaces using intersection matrices.
- [`/cox-rings/`](./cox-rings/) — Zariski decomposition based on the degrees of generators of a finitely generated Cox ring.

Each folder includes its own Magma library and a dedicated README with usage examples and mathematical background.
